### **Project Title**

**One-Click Two-Way Location Sharing**

---

## **1\. Background / Problem Statement**

People often share their location with family or friends, but they still cannot see where the visitor is coming from. This makes it hard to guide visitors, meet halfway, or give real-time directions. In many cases, both people are moving but cannot see each other’s location.

---

## **2\. Project Goal**

To create a very simple system where:

* One person shares their location with one click, and

* When the visitor opens the link, **both people can see each other’s location** automatically.

---

## **3\. Objectives**

* Enable one-click location sharing

* Automatically request the visitor’s location when they open the link

* Display **both locations on the same screen**

* Allow live location updates while both users are moving

* Keep the system simple and easy to use

---

## **4\. Target Users**

* Families visiting each other

* Visitors in new or unfamiliar areas

* Older people and low digital-literacy users

* Community members needing clear directions

---

## **5\. Solution Description (How It Works)**

### **Step 1: Host (Person at Home)**

* Opens the page/app

* Clicks **“Share My Location”**

* A link is generated

* Sends the link via WhatsApp, Messenger, or SMS

### **Step 2: Visitor**

* Clicks the received link

* Sees a message:  
   **“Allow location to help us guide you”**

* Taps **Allow**

### **Step 3: Two-Way Location View**

* The screen shows:

  * 📍 Home location

  * 🚶 Visitor’s current location

* Locations update in real time

No typing, no searching, no map skills needed.

## **6\. Key Features**

* One-click location sharing

* Automatic two-way location sharing (with permission)

* Live location updates

* Clear icons for “You” and “Family”

* Works on mobile phones and browsers

* No login or registration

---

## **7\. Privacy & Safety (Very Important)**

* Visitor must **give permission** to share their location

* Location sharing stops when the page is closed

* No location data is saved permanently

* Clear message explaining what is shared and why

---

## **8\. Method / Approach**

* Use phone GPS and browser location permission

* Build a lightweight web app (no install needed)

* Simple interface using icons and local language

* Test with families and community members

---

## **9\. Expected Results**

* Families can see where visitors are in real time

* Easier guidance: “You’re close, turn left now”

* Less confusion and fewer missed calls

* Faster and safer visits

---

## **10\. Risks and Mitigation**

* **Visitor denies location permission** → Still show host location only

* **Low internet** → Use low-data updates

* **Privacy concerns** → Clear consent and auto-stop sharing

---

## **11\. Sustainability / Future Improvements**

* Voice guidance in local language

* Landmark-based directions

* “I’m here” alert button

* QR code for permanent locations

---

## **12\. Conclusion**

This project makes visiting family easier by allowing both people to see each other’s location in real time. With one click and clear consent, it removes confusion, saves time, and improves connection between people.
